## What Are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** are instruction files that teach AI assistants how to perform specific tasks. They are specialized folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that AI agents dynamically discover and load when relevant to tasks.

Skills employ a **progressive disclosure architecture** for efficiency:
1. **Metadata loading** (~100 tokens): AI scans available Skills to identify relevant matches
2. **Full instructions** (<5k tokens): Load when AI determines the Skill applies
3. **Bundled resources**: Files and executable code load only as needed

## Skills vs Other Approaches

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Skills** | Reusable procedural knowledge across conversations |
| **Prompts** | One-time instructions and immediate context |
| **Projects** | Persistent background knowledge within workspaces |
| **Subagents** | Independent task execution with specific permissions |
| **MCP** | Connecting to external data sources and APIs |

**Key insight**: *If you find yourself typing the same prompt repeatedly across multiple conversations, it's time to create a Skill.*


## FAQ

**Q: How much do skills impact token usage?**  
A: Skills are highly efficient. Each skill uses only ~100 tokens during metadata scanning. When activated, the full skill content loads at <5k tokens.

**Q: What's the difference between Agent Skills and MCP?**  
A: They do different things and work great together:
- **Agent Skills** = teach the AI *how* to do something (workflows, best practices)
- **MCP** = help the AI *access* things (APIs, databases, external tools)

**Q: Do Agent Skills run code?**  
A: No. Skills are just text instructions. If you need to run actual code, you'd use MCP servers alongside skills.

**Q: How do I create my first Agent Skill?**  
A: Create a `SKILL.md` file with a name and description at the top, write clear instructions, put it in your `.github/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` folder, and test it out.


## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Skills can execute arbitrary code in the agent's environment. Only install skills from trusted sources.

- **Review SKILL.md and all scripts** before enabling a skill
- **Be cautious of skills** that request sensitive data access
- **Audit carefully** before deploying to production
